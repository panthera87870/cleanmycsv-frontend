  "hero_title": "Technical Documentation & Cleaning Guide",
  "hero_subtext": "CleanMyCSV is not just a simple filter: it is an intelligent normalization engine that repairs structural errors in your data files to make them immediately actionable.",

  "art1_title": "1. Accent Recovery (Smart Encoding)",
  "art1_p": "The issue of unreadable characters (e.g., <code>Ã©</code> instead of <code>é</code>) stems from a conflict between Windows, Mac, and Web standards.",
  "art1_feature": "<strong>How does it work?</strong> Our engine analyzes your file on three levels: it first attempts <strong>UTF-8</strong> decoding, then switches to <strong>Windows-1252</strong> or <strong>MacRoman</strong> if errors are detected. This ensures perfect readability of your text, regardless of the source tool.",
  "label_before_corrupt": "Before (Corrupt Encoding)",
  "label_after_utf8": "After (UTF-8 Conversion)",

  "art2_title": "2. Separator Detection and Deduplication",
  "art2_p": "A CSV file can use commas, semicolons, or tabs. Choosing the wrong separator when opening it can dump your entire table into a single column.",
  "art2_feature": "<strong>Automation:</strong> CleanMyCSV statistically calculates the most probable separator by analyzing the first 10,000 characters. Additionally, the tool automatically removes empty lines and perfect duplicates to lighten your database.",

  "art3_title": "3. Date Harmonization to ISO Format",
  "art3_p": "Software like Salesforce or HubSpot often requires a strict date format (YYYY-MM-DD). However, human-created files often mix formats.",
  "art3_feature": "<strong>The Solution:</strong> Our algorithm unifies everything to the <code>YYYY-MM-DD</code> standard. It even handles months written in French/English (Jan, Feb, Dec...) and corrects the \"pivot rule\" for two-digit years (e.g., 24 becomes 2024).",
  "label_before_mixed": "Before (Mixed Formats)",
  "label_after_std": "After (Standardized)",

  "art4_title": "4. Amount Cleaning and Currency Extraction",
  "art4_p": "It is impossible to sum cells containing \"150,00 €\". For Excel, that is text, not a number.",
  "art4_feature": "<strong>Financial Intelligence:</strong> CleanMyCSV extracts the currency symbol ($, €, £, CAD...), places it in a dedicated new column called <strong>\"Currency\"</strong>, and transforms the amount into a pure number (decimal point format).",
  "label_before": "Before",
  "label_after_calc": "After (Ready for Calculation)",

  "art5_title": "5. Contact Data Optimization (CRM Ready)",
  "art5_p": "Cleaning emails and phone numbers is the tool's strong suit for marketing teams.",
  "art5_li1": "<strong>Emails:</strong> Removal of stray spaces and systematic conversion to lowercase.",
  "art5_li2": "<strong>Phones:</strong> Normalization to international format (e.g., <code>+33</code> for France).",
  "art5_li3": "<strong>Zip Codes:</strong> Restoration of the initial <code>0</code> often deleted by Excel (e.g., 06100).",
  "art5_li4": "<strong>Names:</strong> Smart capitalization respecting particles (e.g., \"Jean de la Fontaine\").",

  "art6_title": "6. Security: CSV Injection Protection",
  "art6_p": "A CSV file can be a security vulnerability if it contains cells starting with <code>=</code>, <code>+</code>, or <code>-</code>. These characters can force Excel to execute malicious commands.",
  "art6_feature": "<strong>Native Shield:</strong> CleanMyCSV detects these suspicious formulas and neutralizes them by adding a security apostrophe (<code>'</code>). Your computer and corporate network remain protected.",

  "art7_title": "7. The Cleaning Report: Total Transparency",
  "art7_p": "Unlike \"black box\" tools, we provide you with a detailed log (JSON format) of every modification made.",
  "art7_feature": "<strong>Traceability:</strong> This report allows you to verify exactly which cell was modified, what its original value was, and why it was corrected.",
  "label_report_ex": "Report Example",

  "faq_title": "FAQ: Answers to Your Technical Questions",
  "faq_q1": "What is the maximum file size accepted?",
  "faq_a1": "The tool accepts files up to <strong>15 MB</strong>, which typically represents several hundred thousand rows.",
  "faq_q2": "Is my data stored?",
  "faq_a2": "No. Files are processed in the server's RAM and stored temporarily (15 minutes maximum) in a secure space before total deletion.",
  "faq_q3": "Why did a \"Currency\" column appear?",
  "faq_a3": "If the tool detects currency symbols in your amount column, it automatically creates this column so that your figures remain pure numbers usable by your Excel formulas.",
